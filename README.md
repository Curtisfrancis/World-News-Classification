## World-News-Classification
###Overview
This project focuses on classifying news articles into specific categories, using a machine learning approach. Data classification helps organize and categorize data, making it easier to analyze and maintain. By implementing a reliable classification system, organizations can efficiently manage large datasets and ensure data accuracy and integrity.

In the context of text data, news articles provide a rich source of information that can be leveraged to build powerful classification models. The goal of this project is to create an algorithm that can accurately classify previously unseen news articles into the correct category.

###Dataset
For this project, a public dataset from the BBC is used, containing 2,225 articles. Each article is labeled under one of the following five categories:

Business
Entertainment
Politics
Sport
Tech

The dataset is split into two parts:
Training Set: 1,490 articles used to train the model.
Test Set: 735 articles used to evaluate the model's performance.

###Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a classification system that can categorize news articles based on their content. The system will be trained on the provided dataset and will aim to classify new, unseen articles into one of the five categories with high accuracy.

###Features

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data for model training.
Modeling: Implementing machine learning algorithms to classify articles.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on the test dataset.

###Getting Started

To use this classification algorithm, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the script to train and test the classification model on the BBC news dataset.
Future Enhancements
Explore additional classification algorithms for improved accuracy.
Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
Test the model on different datasets or real-time news feeds.
